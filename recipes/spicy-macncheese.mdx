   Mac 'n cheese with a kick. Best with jumbo shells.

This recipe is a combination of a few things. A relative brought this to a family
gathering one time, and I fell in love with it. I asked him how he made it, and 
he described it was a combination of jalapeno cheeses, gruyere, and a little 
cheddar. He used the fancier cheese blocks (no pre-shredded stuff), made a roux, 
then mixed in the shells and baked it.

I had never made a baked, homemade mac'n cheese that way, so I went looking for 
ready-made recipes online and modified it for the spicy version.
