## Ingredients

- 4 bananas
- Cool whip (16oz tub)
- Juice of 1/2 lemon
- Sweetened condensed milk (8oz)
- Instant vanilla pudding mix (small box)
- Nilla wafers (recommended "mini nillas")

- (optional) cinammon, 1 tsp
    

## Directions

1. In a large mixing bowl, mix the instant pudding.

- _Note: the "french vanilla" flavor will give a richer yellow color._
- _**Don't** use milk (per box instructions) for pudding mix. Use water. Milk 
will make the pudding filling too rich for the final dish._
- _Use 1 cup of water (box instructions call for 2 cups liquid)._

2. Integrate condensed milk and whipped cream into pudding mix.

3. (Optional) Store this mixture in the freezer for 10-15 minutes. This helps
stiffen up the mixture for easier layering later on.

4. Peel and cut bananas, sprinkle with lemon juice to keep them from browning
too quickly. _This also helps the flavor once everything is put together._

5. In large serving bowl, start layering the pudding ingredients.
    - Start with a spoonful of the vanilla pudding mixture on bottom of serving
    bowl. _This helps the bottom layer of cookies + bananas stay in place._
    - Then layer banana pieces, laying flat.
    - Layer cookie wafers on/around bananas. _You can "stand" the cookies 
    around the edge, facing the side of the bowl, for better presentation when 
    it's all put together._

6. Repeat layers until the top of the bowl.

7. (Optional) _Topping_
    - Crush several Nilla wafers in a Ziploc bag, and add cinammon to the 
    mixture. Once incorporated, sprinkle this on top of the pudding.
