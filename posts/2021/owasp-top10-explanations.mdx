    An overview of the OWASP Top 10 (2021) listing, explaining the vulnerabilities and throwing in examples 
    where possible.
---

This article starts with the definitions and recommendations from OWASP and includes 
more examples relating OWASP’s listed vulnerabilities to the specific programming 
frameworks we use. While this (lengthy) document covers similar material to OWASP’s Top 
10 list, it is intended to expand on their work with direct and practical examples—not 
a simple re-copy. Visit the OWASP site for the official list.

## The Overlap of OWASP Top 10 Guidance

This can be found here, where OWASP discusses how their data is gathered. Technically speaking, 
if we’re defining vulnerability categories by CWE then there is no overlap. However, for 
conceptual understanding of how these things operate practically, the “overlap” is helpful to 
visualize.

This distinction helps explain why the “top 10” and the proactive controls do not line up 1-to-1.

## A01:2021 &mdash; Broken Access Control

Ref: [https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/)

Access control is all about making sure a user cannot act outside of their intended permissions.

### Common vulnerabilities in this category look like

- Violation of principle of least privilege (i.e. deny by default)
    - Access should only be granted for particular users, roles, capabilities but it's open to anyone
- Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL (i.e. parameter tampering)
    - Also, via modifying application state, HTML page, or some attack tool to modify API requests
- Viewing, editing other user accounts by providing unique identifiers (insecure direct object references)
- API access with missing access controls for POST, PUT and DELETE
- Elevation of privilege
    - Ex: Act as user without being logged on
- Metadata manipulation
    - Abusing JWT invalidation, replaying/tampering with a JWT, or some other access control token or cookie
- CORS misconfiguration allowing API access from unauthorized/untrusted origins
- Force browsing to authenticated pages as unauthenticated user (or to privileged pages as standard user)
