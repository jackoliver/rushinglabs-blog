    An overview of the OWASP Top 10 (2021) listing, explaining the vulnerabilities and throwing in examples 
    where possible.

This article starts with the definitions and recommendations from OWASP and includes 
more examples relating OWASP’s listed vulnerabilities to the specific programming 
frameworks we use. While this (lengthy) document covers similar material to OWASP’s Top 
10 list, it is intended to expand on their work with direct and practical examples—not 
a simple re-copy. Visit the OWASP site for the official list.

## The Overlap of OWASP Top 10 Guidance

This can be found here, where OWASP discusses how their data is gathered. Technically speaking, 
if we’re defining vulnerability categories by CWE then there is no overlap. However, for 
conceptual understanding of how these things operate practically, the “overlap” is helpful to 
visualize.

This distinction helps explain why the “top 10” and the proactive controls do not line up 1-to-1.
