## Other Thoughts

The ["Bored People Quit"](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/bored-people-quit/) article 
from Rands is one of the single most insightful articles I've come across in 
times I was evaluating my career. In fact, I find myself reading it almost annually as a 
sort of evaluation of whatever position I'm in.

It's written to managers and leaders. And I'll say this, while it's interesting to see such 
a message directed to managers/leaders, from the perspective of a developer/individual 
contributor, try to not let this become a hyper-critical view of whatever current 
situation you're in. While I would consider "chronic boredom" with no attempt at recourse 
or engagement from leadership as a definite red-flag--sometimes the remedy lies within 
the individual.

...And _that_ is more the point I'm seeking in this post. Leaders and businesses definitely
have a role to fulfill, and when it doesn't happen real pain is felt. However, that means 
the employees, team members, contributors, individuals, need a means to placing 
intentionality behind their goals...

## Things to do

Take part in social media. Don't do it mindlessly, that would be the time suck so many 
seem to loathe. Take part in it, but do so intentionally.

- Study people's behaviors
- If you have a hard time unplugging, set timers & limits
- Contribute and share

(Mention how Twitter threw job postings at me after sharing I was laid off. While I have
a miniscule audience/circle on Twitter, what little I had paid off as this couldn't 
happen without it.)

(On "contribute & share": while no employer has asked me for anything directly, they 
expressed a lot of gratitude after I shared an in-office whitepaper on software supply
chain security. Albeit indirect, but I was relying on things I had already done while 
blogging.)

Essentially, _play the game_. Or at least be close enough to it to know what's going on.

## _**copy/pasted**_ from my Reddit post

PSA: Own your career => stay on top of your skills and share your work, as healthily as 
you can outside of work.

I was an AppSec Engineer for 2 years at my (now former) employer. I'll likely go back to 
full-stack development. We were building an AppSec program from the ground up, and now 
they've decided to "go in a different business direction". Technically no warning, and not 
large enough layoff to kick in WARN act (US-based), but I had a hunch something was coming 
due to internal politics. Yes, this happened during that portion of the annual review 
period :)

For the junior engineers, here's a few ways I'm learning to do this:

- Start a blog (Wordpress, Squarespace, etc. is okay, and likely best choice). Remember, 
it's about 
showing your work (i.e. marketing), not building everything from scratch. I'm learning 
this the hard way.
- Even that project you think is stupid, easy, cliche...put it on GitHub, and share 
it on your blog. Now, fill out the README.md, try to add tests, get a feel for adding docs. 
Make it nice. When someone lands on the repo, show them around a bit, just like a visitor 
to your house.
- Do you have lasting ideas about said project? How it went? What was hard? Write it on 
the blog, and the produce a video from it. Sure it's tedious, but this shows "passion" 
better than coding an algorithm.

These things above are tedious, and take time. They also cascade into each other. So...

- When you need a break take it. (Same for your PTO) You don't have to dedicate 
your nights & weekends to this unless you want to.
- Time away from the keyboard is time to process.
- Talk to people at conferences (even virtual), and ask the dumb questions. It's okay.
- When the industry likes a new piece of tech...maybe try cert? Or maybe don't. 
But don't knock it til you try it. (just like sushi, lol)
- When you need a break, take it.

These are things I started doing 6 years into my journey as a software engineer. I'm 
still growing, learning, and wish I started practicing this earlier on. I didn't because 
I would get too caught up in what I "had to do", and get burnt out on it too quickly in 
the evenings. Now, that I'm in a layoff, having already practiced this, and some 
severance, is helping me land the next job.

Just wanted to pass it along. It's okay to go slow.
