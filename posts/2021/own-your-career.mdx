## Other Thoughts

The ["Bored People Quit"](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/bored-people-quit/) article 
from Rands is one of the single most insightful articles I've come across in 
times I was evaluating my career. In fact, I find myself reading it almost annually as a 
sort of evaluation of whatever position I'm in.

It's written to managers and leaders. And I'll say this, while it's interesting to see such 
a message directed to managers/leaders, from the perspective of a developer/individual 
contributor, try to not let this become a hyper-critical view of whatever current 
situation you're in. While I would consider "chronic boredom" with no attempt at recourse 
or engagement from leadership as a definite red-flag--sometimes the remedy lies within 
the individual.

...And _that_ is more the point I'm seeking in this post. Leaders and businesses definitely
have a role to fulfill, and when it doesn't happen real pain is felt. However, that means 
the employees, team members, contributors, individuals, need a means to placing 
intentionality behind their goals...

## _**copy/pasted**_ from my Reddit post

PSA: Own your career => stay on top of your skills and share your work, as healthily as 
you can outside of work.

I was an AppSec Engineer for 2 years at my (now former) employer. I'll likely go back to 
full-stack development. We were building an AppSec program from the ground up, and now 
they've decided to "go in a different business direction". Technically no warning, and not 
large enough layoff to kick in WARN act (US-based), but I had a hunch something was coming 
due to internal politics. Yes, this happened during that portion of the annual review 
period :)

For the junior engineers, here's a few ways I'm learning to do this:

- Start a blog (Wordpress, Squarespace, etc. is okay, and likely best choice). Remember, 
it's about 
showing your work (i.e. marketing), not building everything from scratch. I'm learning 
this the hard way.
- Even that project you think is stupid, easy, cliche...put it on GitHub, and share 
it on your blog. Now, fill out the README.md, try to add tests, get a feel for adding docs. 
Make it nice. When someone lands on the repo, show them around a bit, just like a visitor 
to your house.
- Do you have lasting ideas about said project? How it went? What was hard? Write it on 
the blog, and the produce a video from it. Sure it's tedious, but this shows "passion" 
better than coding an algorithm.

These things above are tedious, and take time. They also cascade into each other. So...

- When you need a break take it. (Same for your PTO) You don't have to dedicate 
your nights & weekends to this unless you want to.
- Time away from the keyboard is time to process.
- Talk to people at conferences (even virtual), and ask the dumb questions. It's okay.
- When the industry likes a new piece of tech...maybe try cert? Or maybe don't. 
But don't knock it til you try it. (just like sushi, lol)
- When you need a break, take it.

These are things I started doing 6 years into my journey as a software engineer. I'm 
still growing, learning, and wish I started practicing this earlier on. I didn't because 
I would get too caught up in what I "had to do", and get burnt out on it too quickly in 
the evenings. Now, that I'm in a layoff, having already practiced this, and some 
severance, is helping me land the next job.

Just wanted to pass it along. It's okay to go slow.
