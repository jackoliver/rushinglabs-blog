PSA: Own your career => stay on top of your skills and share your work, as healthily as you can outside of work.

I was an AppSec Engineer for 2 years at my (now former) employer. I'll likely go back to full-stack development. We were building an AppSec program from the ground up, and now they've decided to "go in a different business direction". Technically no warning, and not large enough layoff to kick in WARN act (US-based), but I had a hunch something was coming due to internal politics. Yes, this happened during that portion of the annual review period :)

For the junior engineers, here's a few ways I'm learning to do this:

    Start a blog (Wordpress, Squarespace, etc. is okay, and likely best choice). Remember, it's about showing your work (i.e. marketing), not building everything from scratch. I'm learning this the hard way.

    Even that project you think is stupid, easy, cliche...put it on GitHub, and share it on your blog. Now, fill out the README.md, try to add tests, get a feel for adding docs. Make it nice. When someone lands on the repo, show them around a bit, just like a visitor to your house.

    Do you have lasting ideas about said project? How it went? What was hard? Write it on the blog, and the produce a video from it. Sure it's tedious, but this shows "passion" better than coding an algorithm.

These things above are tedious, and take time. They also cascade into each other. So...

    When you need a break take it. (Same for your PTO) You don't have to dedicate your nights & weekends to this unless you want to.

    Time away from the keyboard is time to process.

    Talk to people at conferences (even virtual), and ask the dumb questions. It's okay.

    When the industry likes a new piece of tech...maybe try cert? Or maybe don't. But don't knock it til you try it. (just like sushi, lol)

    When you need a break, take it.

These are things I started doing 6 years into my journey as a software engineer. I'm still growing, learning, and wish I started practicing this earlier on. I didn't because I would get too caught up in what I "had to do", and get burnt out on it too quickly in the evenings. Now, that I'm in a layoff, having already practiced this, and some severance, is helping me land the next job.

Just wanted to pass it along. It's okay to go slow.
