    An overview of the OWASP Top 10 (2021) listing, explaining the vulnerabilities and throwing in examples 
    where possible.

OWASP Top 10 is considered the "gateway to AppSec", so naturally I'm interested. But diving into 
this, I quickly found it confusing to read about generic security vulnerabilities when I'm used 
to the code snippets and "hands-on style" typically found in developer-friendly blogs, courses, 
and other material. So, I'm attempting to bring the two together: OWASP Top 10 knowledge + 
hands-on code and examples.

This isn't to say I think OWASP has done a poor job, or their work is lacking (quite the contrary).
During my first venture as an AppSec Engineer, I found myself doing a lot of research on how to 
effectively disseminate security info to developers. While every team is different, thus the 
_needs_ of each team is different (security champions, reports, type of code, dev experience) 
each recommendation seemed to resolve down to **meeting developers where they are**.

Thus, with that background I'm off to make OWASP's Top 10 _a little less policy, a little
more code_.
