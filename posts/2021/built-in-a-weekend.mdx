    Have you ever had one of those little ideas for something to build "real quick"? Something not too crazy, but just a fun idea...or maybe something you just hadn't found _quite_ the solution you're looking for? Then suddenly the perfect weekend for it comes up and you decide to pounce. Let's do this. I'm starting with nothing, and not quitting until there's something to show.

Have you ever had one of those little ideas for something to build "real quick"? Something not too crazy, but just a fun idea...or maybe something you just hadn't found _quite_ the solution you're looking for? Then suddenly the perfect weekend for it comes up and you decide to pounce. Let's do this. I'm starting with nothing, and not quitting until there's something to show.

_I finally did that._

The project itself wasn't too exciting. I've been shopping around for a house lately, and I needed an amortization calculator. Nothing crazy. Plenty of them exist online, but I couldn't find one that fit the bill (no pun intended) the way I needed it to. And I've also been looking for an excuse to experiment with the CI/CD tools built into GitHub.

## What to build?

An amortization calculator that incorporates:

- sale price, down payment _leading to_ principal + interest
- home insurance, property tax, and mortgage insurance
- mortgage insurance rolloff term/date
- extra principal payments

Finally, I cut myself some slack around styling the application. Going into this I knew the end result was going to look ugly and plain: 1) because I'm not good with CSS, and 2) the hard deadline.

_Ultimately, the main goal here is be able to plug in some numbers and get a full amortization table back._

## Tools + Tech Stack

The most straightforward way I knew to create this was to create a two distinct applications: a .NET Core REST API for the backend calculations, and React app for the front-end using [`create-react-app`](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

Development
- .NET Core 3.1
- React
- Docker

Again, with the theme of efficient solutions, I'm using GitHub to host the code, but also some extra features have almost made it a default CI platform. Then, Heroku. I've been using their services for a while, so I'm more familiar with them than something like AWS or Azure. I knew that if I could get a Docker container to be agreeable for Heroku, then it was going to be a simple deployment and configuration.

Platform
- GitHub
- Heroku

Finally, I'll be enabling these two tools on the repo to see how they can introduce some application security to the project. I won't be focusing on nailing these down entirely during the first pass of the project. Instead, I would like to see what value there is in enabling them early, and reviewing the findings and workflow later on.

AppSec Tools
- CodeQL
- GitHub Dependabot

## Lessons Learned

An aspect of all this I didn't expect to find was some hidden lessons. Stepping back after it's all done though, it makes sense--placing yourself under pressure (even manufactured) will highlight efficiencies and deficiencies in your habits. 

### "Done is better than perfect"

I've heard this quoted by many people, but this little weekend experiment personified it for me.

I can't count how many times I had to remind myself, "No, this isn't perfect; of course you want to do it better; but rough it in and get it finished." The hard deadline of _midnight Sunday_, ultimately helped me stay focused and prioritize what I was working on in the moment. 

### Expose Weaknesses

Working through this showed me where I was weakest in producing a full-stack solution. (Definitions of "full-stack" and the absence of data retention, notwithstanding) My greatest weaknesses were around deployment, specifically containerizing the front-end and backend portions with Docker, and successfully deploying to Heroku. Much of this just wasn't clear to me, and I found myself relying mostly on Google searches and StackOverflow answers.

For me, "weakness" was synonymous with which aspects took the most time to implement. However another indicator to look for is, watch out for what you're able to document, or explain, the least. I _definitely_ would struggle to fully explain those Dockerfiles, and what makes them work vs. not work.

Second to this, I would say reflect on what features/aspect you're willing to cut from the beginning. Are you cutting them because they take too long or because they're difficult? For me, this was styling and UI. I knew it was going to look ugly, and even though I could eventually get it done it would take up too much time.

## Now What?

The main goal I had set was accomplished. The app was built, and the basic functionality is there. But then what?

I'm interested to see how I can setup a full CI/CD pipeline from my workspace in VS Code, through GitHub, and onto deploying on Heroku. Also now that I'm in a role as an AppSec Engineer, I also would like to see what kind of security tooling can be incorporated into this. The idea of being able to deploy to production, while receiving direct feedback on security, just seems incredible. Especially for hobbyist projects like this where you rarely have the budget and architecture for complete testing and scanning suites.

If you want to see it, check out [this link](https://amortize-client.herokuapp.com/). I'm running this on one of Heroku's free dynos, so it may take about 20-30s to load if the container is asleep.

_I will be continuing to work on this over time, so here's a screenshot to show what I had after this single weekend of work._
