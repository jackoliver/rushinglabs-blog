### TikTok link & Readme.md

[PR #34](https://github.com/meddlin/rushinglabs-blog-nextjs/pull/34) / [PR #44](https://github.com/meddlin/rushinglabs-blog-nextjs/pull/44)

TikTok &mdash; Feels a little weird to write about adding a link, but it was the right time to bring TikTok to 
the About page. Good things are happening over there. &mdash; [@rushinglabs](https://www.tiktok.com/@rushinglabs?lang=en)

Readme &mdash; I hope I can remember to continue keeping the [README](https://github.com/meddlin/rushinglabs-blog-nextjs#readme) 
updated. Not much to say here; _it's all [over there](https://github.com/meddlin/rushinglabs-blog-nextjs#readme)_ ðŸ˜…

### Blog preview

[PR #55](https://github.com/meddlin/rushinglabs-blog-nextjs/pull/55)

I wanted to be able to show a preview of the post's content directly inline with the list of blog posts. This is 
commonly done on blogs, but I just hadn't taken the time to finish this feature. A slight quirk though,
I am using [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter) to parse the frontmatter metadata packaged 
with each post. _Which means this frontmatter is a block of YAML._

I quickly figured out that line breaks aren't valid in YAML properties by themselves. However, with a little 
bit of special syntax 

<MyHighlighter language="bash">

In addition to this "preview", there's also a new "Read More" link below the preview for each post.

### Code QL

[PR #41](https://github.com/meddlin/rushinglabs-blog-nextjs/pull/41)

Code QL is a free SAST tool from GitHub, completely free, and available to integrate directly within your projects. I 
haven't started to truly use it yet, but I made sure to incorporate it into the site so it's there.
