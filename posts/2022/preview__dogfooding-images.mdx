While pulling together the [Pedernales Falls hiking](/link-goes-here) post, I realized my process for 
creating and adding images (or really any content) to the site needed to change.

Process to create content for website:

- Capture
- Ingest and review
- (opt.) Edit
- Convert to compressed web formats
- Upload to CMS (AWS S3)
- Link to page
