    Wow!...GitHub has a lot of tools for managing repos!

## Repo

This is where your code lives.

## Issues

Tracking _stuff to do_ AND _stuff that's wrong_

"an issue to be addressed, not necessarily an issue to be resolved"...if that makes sense.


## Projects

Milestones

- Think of these as checkpoints along your "path of project progress". I like to break these 
down into v1.0, v1.5 as my milestones. And then assign the issues to those milestones that I 
think should go into that version, or make sense to go together. Sometimes it's "do these 
issues/features belong together?" and other times it's more timeline driven like, "what can 
I get done by X date?"

Category (custom field)

- Think of these as a "type of issue", or a "_category_". Take a look at the default labels.
If these are making sense for your project, then maybe don't consider this custom field.
_However!_ consider if you have, say...10 issues...which all have the same label(s), then isn't 
that becoming a natual "grouping" of those issues? Kind of like a category.

Status 

- Just plain, good-to-have: todo, in progress, and done. Feel free to add more as necessary.

### Fields I Use

- Status
- Milestones
- Category


## Projects: Customizing the views 

You can create varied "views" of the same project data, store them to view the project from different 
perspectives, and even rename the views accordingly!
