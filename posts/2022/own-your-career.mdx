# Problem

A recent layoff from my first AppSec role left me reflecting...

After a tough job, then a layoff, and finally a quick end to a longer 
job search. I needed to take inventory of where I'd been, and where I want to go with this 
sticky, messy no-good thing called a career. I'm hoping to reflect, make sense of it, and 
come away with practical knowledge I can apply going forward.

of the path I've chosen and experienced. So, I hope this articles helps others in some 
way, but it's not meant to be prescriptive.

# Reflection

I've been bored for a long time. Roughly 7 years ago I was happy to graduate from college 
with a B.S. in Computer Science, and convert to full-time work from the internship I 
was already working. Honestly...it felt good. Four and a half years of work. Payoff.

Endless studying, dubious tests, and the constant churn of assignments turned into 
stable, practical applied knowledge. _Work_. Then I realized it: endless studying was 
constant engagement. Dubious tests were clear, direct progression markers&mdash;_feedback_. And 
churning assignments were new curiousities being entertained.

The work I hoped for became a shift to the mundane. Five jobs later&mdash;five teams, 
five environments&mdash;still the same. It was all business software development though.
That was the answer, right? A new mission focus should fix it&mdash;work focus. I had been
interested in infosec for a while afterall. Yeah, my first AppSec role.

Nope. Now, having left/been separated (layoffs are strange things) from this latest role,
I could give it the same retroactive corporate psycho-analysis I gave my other jobs, but 
that strategy doesn't appear to be working. It's not answering things. I need to look within.

## Reflection Thoughts: "Bored People Quit"

There's an article aptly named ["Bored People Quit"](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/bored-people-quit/). 
(You may see why it piqued my interest.)

It was written by Rands, circa 2011, and is one of the most insightful
articles I've come across in the  
times I was evaluating my career. In fact, it has sort of become this meta-checkpoint I 
return to almost annually, to re-evaluate where I'm at; how I'm feeling. Often it's a 
telling marker.

It's addressed to managers and leaders. And I'll say this, while it's interesting to see such 
a message directed to that group&mdash;if you're reading it as a developer/individual 
contributor, try to not let it become a hyper-critical view of whatever current 
situation you're in. While I would consider "chronic boredom", with no attempt at recourse 
or engagement, from leadership as a definite red-flag&mdash;sometimes (often times?) the 
true remedy lies within the individual. 

In fact, the article points to a certain responsibility leaders have, it never makes the point 
that full burden of the solution lies upon the leader. It's still the engineer. Rands only 
highlights how leaders can detect boredom, spotlight it, present it, and ultimately 
help their peers work through it.

...And _that_ is more the point I'm seeking to make in this post. Leaders and businesses 
definitely have a role to fulfill, and when it doesn't happen real pain is felt. However, 
that means the employees, team members, contributors, individuals, all need a means to placing 
intentionality behind their goals...

If it sounds messy it's because it is.

# Action

What am I doing about it?

(Start with catharsis)
- Taking notes about previous jobs is a good start
    - It's: cathartic, documenting, organizes thoughts, brings self-awareness

(Seems like there's a series of questions here)
- Ask: What do you want to be when you grow up?
    - No, seriously. Spend some time on this one. Go for a run, a hike, and ruminate on it.
    - Remember those dreams this question sprung up as a kid? Are there any markers from back
    then? Any dreams left on the table due to practicality?
- Related: Is "what you want to do", still..."what you want to do?"
    - Basically, are you happy? Is there a better adjective for how you feel? --> What is it?

(Turning those questions into actionable steps)
- Find some time to follow some interests right now
    - Do you have time to "selfishly" investigate a curiousity that's been bugging you?
        - _Hint: it's not selfish_
        - Even if the interest isn't practical explore it. We're taking a detour from that
        sucky career journey. Allow for possible wrong turns. It'll be okay.

- For me: this turned into side projects I wanted, showing my work, and gaming.
    - Side projects: Stuff I wanted, but didn't know was even possible or pragmatic.
        - A better personal finance tool
        - Finish my website
        - Archived school notes
        - A reliable PC workstation
        - Networking + OSINT tools _"for **me**"_
    - Showing my work: YouTube + website
        - YouTube intimidates me. It also highlights my perfectionism bias. Cool; _feedback_.
        - The website project from above translates well here.
        - And this has led me to start learning more about marketing and social media 
        management than I previously thought was worth anything.
    - Gaming 
        - Maybe a better outlet than previously thought.
        - Could I somehow tie it into the other things above?

Here's how I've generalized my "things to do"

Own the situation by seeking self-awareness and learning from it
- Take notes about the situation(s). At the very least it's cathartic.
- Ask pointed and pertinent questions. If you can't answer them; good. Grab some lunch, and 
come back. These answers are worth it.
- Explore. The answers, the thoughts, the interests...all of it.

Finally, possibly the most prescriptive...

- Share.
- Yeah, social media sucks. I know. Tech is also a group effort (a "team sport", pick your 
metaphor).

But for all the adages about "who you know", and networking, connecting, etc. There's 
something to be said about engaging with others, in some fashion, and sharing what you're 
doing. What you're working on.


It's okay to go slow.



# (an update, concluding this post...) -- Action-- 

_NOTE: Finding direction_

Posted an open question to Reddit, "Here is {insert thing} what I want to do...what is that called?", 
and I found that this is really all just software engineering. **_It's a matter of finding the 
specific domain, though._**

Wanting to build and innovate on decentralized networks, containerization, etc. is all contained in 
software engineering. Being an AppSec Eng is really about managing software, teams, vulns, and 
communications between Security and Software teams. For the most part, it has very little to do with 
writing or building the tools.

_What's that mean?_
So...back to software engineering, _not infosec_, and there's a focus on the network security domain.

_How to find how to do this in a career?_
This isn't near as big of a domain/area as web development,
business software (.NET, Java enterprise-y stuff), game dev, etc. so we're left to look for 
companies that build the type of thing I want to work on.

_And how do we work at those places?_
Back to leveling up in coding, projects, and skills to be qualified to work at those places. Just the 
same as if I wanted to switch into game dev, AI/ML, or any other domain. Also, we're fortunate that 
many of these companies now allow remote work, too.




## Things to do

Take part in social media. Don't do it mindlessly, that would be the time suck so many 
seem to loathe. Take part in it, but do so intentionally.

- Study people's behaviors
- If you have a hard time unplugging, set timers & limits
- Contribute and share

(Mention how Twitter threw job postings at me after sharing I was laid off. While I have
a miniscule audience/circle on Twitter, what little I had paid off as this couldn't 
happen without it.)

(On "contribute & share": while no employer has asked me for anything directly, they 
expressed a lot of gratitude after I shared an in-office whitepaper on software supply
chain security. Albeit indirect, but I was relying on things I had already done while 
blogging.)

Essentially, _play the game_. Or at least be close enough to it to know what's going on.

## _**copy/pasted**_ from my Reddit post

PSA: Own your career => stay on top of your skills and share your work, as healthily as 
you can outside of work.

I was an AppSec Engineer for 2 years at my (now former) employer. I'll likely go back to 
full-stack development. We were building an AppSec program from the ground up, and now 
they've decided to "go in a different business direction". Technically no warning, and not 
large enough layoff to kick in WARN act (US-based), but I had a hunch something was coming 
due to internal politics. Yes, this happened during that portion of the annual review 
period :)

For the junior engineers, here's a few ways I'm learning to do this:

- Start a blog (Wordpress, Squarespace, etc. is okay, and likely best choice). Remember, 
it's about 
showing your work (i.e. marketing), not building everything from scratch. I'm learning 
this the hard way.
- Even that project you think is stupid, easy, cliche...put it on GitHub, and share 
it on your blog. Now, fill out the README.md, try to add tests, get a feel for adding docs. 
Make it nice. When someone lands on the repo, show them around a bit, just like a visitor 
to your house.
- Do you have lasting ideas about said project? How it went? What was hard? Write it on 
the blog, and the produce a video from it. Sure it's tedious, but this shows "passion" 
better than coding an algorithm.

These things above are tedious, and take time. They also cascade into each other. So...

- When you need a break take it. (Same for your PTO) You don't have to dedicate 
your nights & weekends to this unless you want to.
- Time away from the keyboard is time to process.
- Talk to people at conferences (even virtual), and ask the dumb questions. It's okay.
- When the industry likes a new piece of tech...maybe try cert? Or maybe don't. 
But don't knock it til you try it. (just like sushi, lol)
- When you need a break, take it.

These are things I started doing 6 years into my journey as a software engineer. I'm 
still growing, learning, and wish I started practicing this earlier on. I didn't because 
I would get too caught up in what I "had to do", and get burnt out on it too quickly in 
the evenings. Now, that I'm in a layoff, having already practiced this, and some 
severance, is helping me land the next job.

Just wanted to pass it along. It's okay to go slow.
