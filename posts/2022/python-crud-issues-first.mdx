## Learning a new thing 

Upon starting a new job, I was challenged by for the first time being in a place 
that doesn't use any language I have previous/extensive experience in. And we 
have quite the variety too: mostly Python, Java, JavaScript...and sparse bash, 
Powershell, PHP, PL-SQL, and a few others.

**But!** our infosec team has chosen to standardize on Python for any new tooling 
that needs writing, so here's to me diving into Python by trying to build a small 
web app. Ideally, I'd like to build a little budgeting app (the UI similar to
EveryDollar), but with a few extra features for pulling in email receipts and 
balancing records from my bank.

So, I thought it would be interesting to capture some first impressions about 
getting into Python and these frameworks. Learning curve and mistakes imminent...


## Flask vs FastAPI

- Flask seems biased towards monolithic apps
    - it's possible to create REST API/data-only service-based apps, but it 
    feels like you aren't supposed to.
- FastAPi has a bend toward asynchronous, service-based APIs

- Not sure if this is actually how either of these frameworks are structured,
but that is the "feel" I get after working with both of them.

## UUID issue

Describing UUIDs as `UUID(as_uuid = True)` was necessary in sqlalchemy models.

<MyHighlighter language="python">
{` id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key = True, default=uuid.uuid4) `}
</MyHighlighter>

This piece stumped me for a bit. Specifically because, to me, `Column(UUID)` 
looks like it should describe the data type for this column just fine. Primary 
key is fine. Setting a default for the server is fine. But why specify a `UUID`
is going to be written `as_uuid=True`...what else would it be?? I'm sure there's 
a good reason, but it stumped me for a bit, lol


## Direct vs. Declarative for sqlalchemy Models

The one thing I would have to say is most difficult about learning Python is the 
disparate documentation. Documentation certainly exists, but it's not always 
consistent. Admittedly, I think I've been spoiled by the C#/.NET ecosystem that I 
started programming in. There isn't the same type of relationship between tools and 
docs in Python as there is with Visual Studio + Intellisense + Microsoft Docs + 
.NET libaries & APIs. Not a detriment to Python, but increased the learning curve 
for me.

Such, as running into the issue where I needed to know how to declare relationships 
within my sqlalchemy models: [https://hackersandslackers.com/implement-sqlalchemy-orm/](https://hackersandslackers.com/implement-sqlalchemy-orm/)

Then, I find out the example in that link (directly above) was using the "declarative"
Table class, and some other tutorial/article guided me towards using a "direct" Table 
class: [https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/declarative_tables.html](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/declarative_tables.html)




## Debugging FastAPI

Ref: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60205056/debug-fastapi-application-in-vscode](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60205056/debug-fastapi-application-in-vscode)

More on that topic of tools + language ecosystem integration, debugging always seems to be 
a questionable area. Debugging a simple Python script couldn't be easier: (1) load in VS Code, 
(2) set breakpoints, (3) run. However, using a framework like Flask, Fast API, or anything else 
seems to mean finding a debug configuration, and loading that into your editor.

So here's the configuration needed for FastAPI, in `launch.json`, for VSCode. The extra pieces in 
the `args` section are important. Throw this in your `launch.json`, and you should be good 
to go.

<MyHighlighter language="json">
{`
"version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Python: FastAPI",
      "type": "python",
      "request": "launch",
      "module": "uvicorn",
      "cwd": "\${workspaceFolder}/<folder to your main.py>",
      "args": [
        "main:app",
        "--reload",
        "--port", //these arg are optional
        "3003"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
`}
</MyHighlighter>

## Conclusion

Overall, having used Python sparingly before diving into these web frameworks, it definitely required 
less effort than I expected to get something functional on screen. That aspect of Python continues to 
amaze me. Whether it's web frameworks, AI/ML tooling, or scripts, Python always seems to require 
minimal _developer-hand-written code_ to produce what you want on screen. But to build a full-featured,
robust, secure API-driven web application...I don't know if I would want to commit to doing so in Python.
The feeling of a full ecosystem, tooling, docs, and support just doesn't seem to be there.
