# Flask vs FastAPI

- Flask seems biased towards monolithic apps
    - it's possible to create REST API/data-only service-based apps, but it 
    feels like you aren't supposed to.
- FastAPi has a bend toward asynchronous, service-based APIs

- Not sure if this is actually how either of these frameworks are structured,
but that is the "feel" I get after working with both of them.

# UUID issue

The `UUID(as_uuid = True)` was necessary in sqlalchemy models.

<MyHighlighter language="python">
{` id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key = True, default=uuid.uuid4) `}
</MyHighlighter>

# Direct vs. Declarative for sqlalchemy Models

The one thing I would have to say is most difficult about learning Python is the 
disparate documentation. Documentation certainly exists, but it's not always 
consistent.

Such, as running into the issue where I needed to know how to declare relationships 
within my sqlalchemy models: [https://hackersandslackers.com/implement-sqlalchemy-orm/]
(https://hackersandslackers.com/implement-sqlalchemy-orm/)

Then, I find out the example in that link (directly above) was using the "declarative"
Table class, and some other tutorial/article guided me towards using a "direct" Table 
class: [https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/declarative_tables.html]
(https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/declarative_tables.html)

_This is, generally speaking, on top of other examples where I can't really trust the 
documentation quality of any particular library and there doesn't appear to be a 
centralized source.




# Debugging FastAPI

Ref: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60205056/debug-fastapi-application-in-vscode](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60205056/debug-fastapi-application-in-vscode)

This is the key configuration we need in `launch.json` for VSCode. The extra pieces in 
the `args` section are important. Throw this in your `launch.json`, and you should be good 
to go.

<MyHighlighter language="json">
