    This is what I wish my blogging experience could be. And I havenn't found it yet, 
    so I'm building it.

## Intro

I bought an iPad because it looked like the perfect "almost computer". It checks all these boxes 
I didn't know I had. A great touchscreen experience. Fully-featured apps. A _magic_ keyboard! Even 
pencil support! It is the perfect tool for nearly every possible task I use a computer for.

Except coding.

Why just use a traditional laptop, right? It runs any binary, can handle nearly any web development 
task. _And most any computing task._ Except...limited touchscreen for easier photo manipulation. Most have 
no pencil support for drawing capabilities. And it's heavier, less battery life, larger package, etc. 

I still had computers at home, and could definitely get my hands on a laptop should I need to eject from 
my iPad idea. So, I set off to see if I could solve this "coding on an iPad" problem.

## What Do I Want?

Most of what I'm looking for is web development. It can largely be achieved with a text editor and (some 
type of) live preview mechanism. And by far, the most web development I still do these days is for my 
personal website. Blogging mostly. Authoring MDX files.

It'd be great if I could do this from the convenience of an iPad, right?

Well, let's back up.

_Why MDX?_ The original idea for this was for Markdown. Editing Markdown on an iPad is pretty straightforward,
and doing so within VSCode's web editor is possible on an iPad. Problem solved, right? Hardly.

- Writing Markdown for prose content
- Handle images (centering, left-, and right-aligned)
- Captions, credits, alt-text for images
- Syntax highlighting
- Interactive code demonstrations

...explain the rest of how I found myself needing to edit MDX from an iPad
