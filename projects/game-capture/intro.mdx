    Explaining how I setup my game capture videos: hardware choices, software
    configs, and a few other tips.

Someone on TikTok asked me to demonstrate how I setup and edit my game capture
videos to show them on TikTok. There's quite a bit that goes into it, so I made
a series of videos for TikTok. Here's that list :)

### Part 1 - Hardware

Let's get started with some basic hardware to get this going. 

- Capture card - I use an Elgato 4k60 Pro
- A PC, for the capture card
- Game console (_see the footage from_  
[Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OnAABoLpso&list=PLQUqqIZYcDSt6__8-a5K6ebFGGTYCBonL&index=1&t=1s), _PS5_)
- A camera
- (_optional_) 2nd monitor

### Part 2 - Camera: smartphone option

When I first started making video content, everything I filmed was on my phone.
So, an app like DroidCam really helped me out.

[DroidCam](https://www.dev47apps.com/) (Android/iOS app) is a great option for 
sending your smartphone's camera to [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), on your PC.

### Part 3 - Camera: digital camera

After using my phone for a while, I upgraded to a more regular camera. The 
Sony ZV-E10 has an APS-C sensor, and let's me use Sony's E-mount lenses if
I ever need to upgrade later on.

- Elgato Camlink 4K
