Access control is all about making sure a user cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Or in 
other words, make sure a user can't do what they aren't supposed to do.

### Common vulnerabilities in this category look like

- Violation of principle of least privilege (i.e. deny by default)
    - Access should only be granted for particular users, roles, capabilities but it's open to anyone
- Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL (i.e. parameter tampering)
    - Also, via modifying application state, HTML page, or some attack tool to modify API requests
- Viewing, editing other user accounts by providing unique identifiers (insecure direct object references)
- API access with missing access controls for POST, PUT and DELETE
- Elevation of privilege
    - Ex: Act as user without being logged on
- Metadata manipulation
    - Abusing JWT invalidation, replaying/tampering with a JWT, or some other access control token or cookie
- CORS misconfiguration allowing API access from unauthorized/untrusted origins
- Force browsing to authenticated pages as unauthenticated user (or to privileged pages as standard user)

### Defensive Design & Prevention

- Except for public resources, deny by default
- Implement access control mechanisms once and re-use them throughout the application,
including minimizing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) usage.
- Model access controls should enforce record ownership rather than accepting
that the user can create, read, update, or delete any record.
- Unique application business limit requirements should be enforced by domain models.
- Disable web server directory listing and ensure file metadata (e.g., .git) and backup files 
are not present within web roots.
- Log access control failures, alert admins when appropriate (e.g., repeated failures).
- Rate limit API and controller access to minimize the harm from automated
attack tooling.
- Stateful session identifiers should be invalidated on the server after logout. Stateless JWT tokens 
should rather be short-lived so that the window of opportunity for an attacker is minimized. For longer 
lived JWTs it's highy recommended to follow the OAuth standards to revoke access.
