# A01:2021 &mdash; Broken Access Control

Ref: [https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/)

Access control is all about making sure a user cannot act outside of their intended permissions.

### Common vulnerabilities in this category look like

- Violation of principle of least privilege (i.e. deny by default)
    - Access should only be granted for particular users, roles, capabilities but it's open to anyone
- Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL (i.e. parameter tampering)
    - Also, via modifying application state, HTML page, or some attack tool to modify API requests
- Viewing, editing other user accounts by providing unique identifiers (insecure direct object references)
- API access with missing access controls for POST, PUT and DELETE
- Elevation of privilege
    - Ex: Act as user without being logged on
- Metadata manipulation
    - Abusing JWT invalidation, replaying/tampering with a JWT, or some other access control token or cookie
- CORS misconfiguration allowing API access from unauthorized/untrusted origins
- Force browsing to authenticated pages as unauthenticated user (or to privileged pages as standard user)
