Ref: [https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_%28SSRF%29/](https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_%28SSRF%29/)

### Defensive Design & Prevention

- Segment remote resource access functionality in separate networks to reduce the impact of SSRF
- Enforce “deny by default” firewall policies or network access control rules to block all but essential intranet traffic.
    - Hints:
        - Establish an ownership and a lifecycle for firewall rules based on applications.
        - Log all accepted and blocked network flows on firewalls
