    Explaining how I setup my development environment for developing and debugging
    Python Flask API projects in VSCode.

### Getting Started

Ref: [https://www.tutlinks.com/setup-visual-studio-code-for-python-development/](https://www.tutlinks.com/setup-visual-studio-code-for-python-development/)

Start here. It's a good explanation for starting from zero.

- Install Python extension (_see note at end of this page for a specific bug_)
- (optional) install GitLens, GitHistory extensions
- Select interpreter
- Select linter

This also covers creating a `settings.json` for the `./vscode` directory. This is where
VSCode stores the project-specific configurations for your Python project.

It's very important for consistency, and (if you're using git) can help other project 
contributors get setup easily. _So, it's best to commit it to the git repo._


### Setup Python environment, packages

Ref: [https://www.tutlinks.com/debugging-flask-app-with-vs-code-made-easy/](https://www.tutlinks.com/debugging-flask-app-with-vs-code-made-easy/)

For setting up a Python venv (virtual environment) in your project:

```bash
# cd [to-your-project-directory]
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> _Note: If you're building a service-based web app (web client + API), and you have both
pieces in the same repo...make sure you are in the `/api` directory where your Python code 
exists before executing those instructions._

We need a debug configuration, too. `Ctrl+Shift+D` in VSCode is a shortcut to the debug 
panel. This will guide you through creating a `launch.json`, in the `./vscode` directory.
_See? That directory is extra important to be included in the git repo._

`launch.json` holds the debug config for your Python Flask project. More debug configs can
be added here if, for some reason, you need multiple debug configs on the same project.

Make sure you change the `FLASK_APP` variable to match what you've named the entry point 
for your Python project. _Default is `app.py`, but we're building an API._

```json
"env": {
        "FLASK_APP": "api\\api.py",
        "FLASK_ENV": "development"
    },
```


### Writing a `requirements.txt`

- Ref: [https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-pip-install-requirements/](https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-pip-install-requirements/)

Here's an example `requirements.txt`:

```bash
###### Requirements without Version Specifiers ######
nose
nose-cov
beautifulsoup4

###### Requirements with Version Specifiers ######
docopt == 0.6.1             # Version Matching. Must be version 0.6.1
keyring >= 4.1.1            # Minimum version 4.1.1
coverage != 3.5             # Version Exclusion. Anything except version 3.5
Mopidy-Dirble ~= 1.1        # Compatible release. Same as >= 1.1, == 1.*
```


### Problem with Python extension for VSCode

- Ref: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/724858/vscode-debugger-not-working-for-python.html](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/724858/vscode-debugger-not-working-for-python.html)
- Ref: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71019671/vscode-debugger-stops-suddenly-python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71019671/vscode-debugger-stops-suddenly-python)

At some point in the whole setup process, my Python environment started acting weird. The 
debugger would start and then immediately stop. Somehow `flask` would no longer be detected
for import. Yet enabling the python `env`, and installing from `pip` would result in all
packages returning saying they were already installed.

I downgraded the VSCode Python extension to the latest release from 2021, and restarted 
VSCode, and this seemed to be enough to get things going again. _The two links listed above
also described similar behavior, and stated this solution worked. Unsure why the bug exists._
