## Default Dynamic Zoom

Enable "Dynamic Zoom" in the "Inspector" tab

## Linear Pan - Dynamic Zoom

- After enabling “Dynamic Zoom” from the “Inspector” tab for your required 
clip in the timeline, click on the dropdown in the bottom left corner of the 
timeline viewer and select the “Dynamic Zoom” option.
- The green box represents the starting size and position of the zoom and the 
red box represents the ending size and position of the zoom.
- Click inside the border of the green box and move it to the left for a pan 
effect. Drag the border to resize the zoom to your taste.
- You will see a line or motion path connecting the 2 boxes.
- Now click on the red border and resize it to the same size as the green one 
and drag the box to the right side. (The same size will ensure no zoom out or 
in. Alternatively, you can resize the boxes for panning and zooming in/out at 
the same time).
- Select “Linear” (or any other option according to your taste) against “Dynamic 
Zoom Ease” for gradual speed from the start of the clip to the end of the clip.
- Now play the clip. It should pan from left to right with your required zoom.
