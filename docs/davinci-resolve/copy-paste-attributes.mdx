    How to copy and paste attributes between clips on the timeline. Ever had a clip adjusted with
    zoom and positioning just right, and wanted to drop those same settings on another clip
    on the timeline? Here's how to do it.

Ref: [https://beginnersapproach.com/davinci-resolve-copy-paste/](https://beginnersapproach.com/davinci-resolve-copy-paste/)

- Click source clip, Ctrl + C
- Right-click destination clip, Alt + V (Option + V, on Mac)
- Paste attributes window will open
- Select desired attributes to paste
- Click "Apply"

Doing this again on the timeline will have the attributes, in the attributes window, already
selected.
