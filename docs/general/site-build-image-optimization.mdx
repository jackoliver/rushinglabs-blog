    Steps taken to optimize images used on the landing page for this site.
---


Before getting into this, it's important to realize _this is an optimization problem._ So,
we're looking for "adequately good enough" results.

- Without taking too much development time
- Make simple-as-possible changes
- Strive for repeatable results/changes

## Quick Tips (tl;dr;)

1. Check Next.js `next/image` docs
2. Cover your bases, install the `sharp` npm package
3. Resize images & convert to WebP


## Tracking the changes made

This is what it looked starting out. Notice the slow image loading.

### Next.js Image component doc

This is good to read just to make sure we're using all of the basic functionality
that's required.

### Check for the sharp package

As covered here, this is automatically handled in production for Vercel deployments, but I'm
adding it anyway just to be safe in case I ever move to another hosting provider.

```bash
npm install sharp
```

### Image Format

Switching to the WebP format could provide some performance benefits over the PNG
format. However, we need to be wary of browser support before switching our images
over to this format.

    - _Note: The only browser to have an issue is Safari on Mac OS Big Sur._


### Converting PNG to WebP

I needed to convert PNG to WebP. Seemingly, the easiest way to do this after a cursory Google
search is to use any of the dozen online auto-converters. However, this is _very_ manual, and 
we have no controls over quality. (Also, what's happening with my image on their servers?)

**So!** Looking for some way to do this locally, we have [this section](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) 
of the [Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/) site on [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp).

Download the utility, run the following command, and you get your new WebP.

```bash
cwebp -q 80 image.png -o image.webp
```

_Note: It would be really nice to configure this utility to the Windows context menu (or automate
it in some way) to create the ability for batch conversion._ ðŸ˜Ž

Suggested to use the `sharp` package for production deployment. The StackOverflow post 
recommends using this, and I've included the link to the "Sharp Missing in Production"
article where they explain more why this is necessary.

_It's automatically handled on Vercel deployments (which I use), but since I want this repeatable 
on as many deployed environments as possible, I'll add this package anyway._

- sharp package: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp)

They're suggesting to use the priority prop and make use of 
the WebP format.
