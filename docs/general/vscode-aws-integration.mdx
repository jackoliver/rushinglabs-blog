## AWS from VSCode

This doc explains various ways to interact with S3 buckets--including via the
VSCode Command Palette, after installing the AWS Toolkit extension.

_Looks like you can do more with it than just S3 buckets, too._

### Why?

This could be useful for having a better authoring experience, while writing articles,
from within VSCode. Currently, writing articles goes extremely well, _**but**_ creating 
images (i.e. taking screenshots) completely removes me from the "flow" due to how 
tedious the upload process is.
